# Build-REST-API-in-Flask

This Repository is a part of the "Build REST API on Flask" project in Educative.io

I think Applying my skills with hands-on projects like this is a great way to get comfortable with new techniques and technologies.

In this application,I wrote the code to create a REST API using the Flask-RESTX extension provided for Flask. To test what I have developed, I tried all the endpoints. Tried to add, delete, update, and retrieve movies present in the database.
